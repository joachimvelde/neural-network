# Neural network
This is a neural network implemented in python, that is currently set to be trained
on the mnist dataset to guess digits between zero and nine.
It is very primitive and optimized for ooga booga brains

## For blubber.py
Here is a diagram explaining the dimensions of the different matrices in the network. I have upgraded to using a single weight matrix and bias matrix for each layer. However, this upgrade has proven to be detremental to my mental well being.

## For less_basic.py
Here is a sad diagram "explaining" nothing
