# Neural network
This is a shitty neural network implemented in a shitty language

## For blubber.py
Here is a diagram explaining the dimensions of the different matrices in the network. I have upgraded to using a single weight matrix and bias matrix for each layer. However, this upgrade has proven to be detremental to my mental well being.

## For less_basic.py
Here is a sad diagram "explaining" nothing

## TODO
* Put matrix operations in a separate file -> possibly inside a class? Check common practice
* Implement backpropagation
